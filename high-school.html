                    <p>One of my projects in my <i>Engineering Applications</i> class was a toy development project. My choice was a toy tractor. I created CAD models of individual parts as well as the assembled toy, and 3D printed the parts to make a real-life model.</p>
                    <p>I submitted this project to the Michigan Industrial and Technology Education Society (MITES) 2017 student competition, and my design won first place in its category.</p>

                    <p>In the ASBE Foundation design challenge, students are given an industry based problem and are challenged with finding a design solution. CAD drafting and artistic skills that students have gained in their classes can be directly applied to an automotive based design problem with the design challenge. The Engineering Design category asks the drafting student to create a functional design solution to an automotive based problem.</p>
                    <p>The 2017 challenge was a fuel door. My design included a threaded gas cap and a door on a hinge, and it won fourth place in the Engineering Design category.</p>

                    <p>In my <i>Engineering Applications</i> class, I learned how to code in C++ and how to use an Arduino. One of my assignments was to build an autonomous vehicle. I teamed up with another student, and I worked on the electronics and programming while he worked on the computer-aided design and 3D printing.</p>
                    <p>We decided to take a creative approach to this assignment and create an ice cream truck instead of a regular car. The truck uses one Arduino to drive its four wheels with servo motors, poll the ultrasonic sensor on the front of the truck, and adjust its path if there's anything in its way. Another Arduino is used to flash text across the liquid crystal display (LCD) and play music as it drives. The LCD displays the name of the song currently playing as well as a fun message.</p>

                    <p>As gifts for the seniors in my high school marching band's mellophone section, I made custom French horn clocks. I used a scroll saw to cut out French horn shapes and a router to round the edges and make space for the clock mechanism on the wall side of the clocks. To finish them up, I spray-painted the clocks gold so they would look like real French horns!</p>

                    <p>Since I had shared pictures of my French horn clocks with members of my robotics team, they asked if I could do a similar project to make thank-you gifts for our team's mentors. Team mentors are industry professionals who volunteer their time to teach students engineering and business concepts and help us build a robot.</p>
                    <p>These thank-you gifts are 3D versions of the team's logo. I created CAD models of the clocks, 3D printed them, and inserted a clock mechanism on the wall side of each print.</p>
